# Bob's Computer Shop

Today was his lucky day. Bob's, who was a computer science graduate but works at Walmart, got his money for the court case he had been fighting for a month. One day, he was walking out of Walmart to go home, thinking about how he could make his dream of owning a computer shop come true. He was zoned out and wasn't aware of his surroundings. A Red Ford pickup hit him from the left side and led him to the hospital. A month later, he won his court case and got $13,000,000. He quit his Walmart job and decided to open his own computer shop.
